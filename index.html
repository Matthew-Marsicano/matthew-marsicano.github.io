            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>As a current Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Northeastern University, I have prioritized building a diverse skill set tailored toward the interconnect of hardware and software development in FPGA/ASIC domain. </p>
            <p>I'm driven by discovering and solving complex technical challenges throughout all stages and layers of the development process. My proven track record of professional engineering impact extends to my current Backscatter Radio co-op at Nokia Bell Labs, as well as my previous Embedded Software Engineering Internship at DEKA Research and Development. </p>
            <h3>---Engineering for Community Impact---</h3>
            <p>My recent role as a Hardware Engineer at Generate Product Development involved pioneering the user interface for Tubender, a tool revolutionizing the work of electricians. This venture not only honed my PCB design skills but also allowed me to apply my knowledge in digital circuitry and embedded software principles, directly impacting the trade's efficiency. </p>
            <p> My commitment to practical education extends to my previous positions as Makerspace Electronics Lead at the Michael J. and Ann Sherman Center for Engineering Entrepreneurship Education and Electrical Engineering Specialist for Forge, where I facilitate student growth through workshops and hands-on guidance in electrical circuit design. Here, my role nurtured a community of interdisciplinary engineers, leveraging my academic pursuits to foster an environment of collaboration and product innovation.</p>
            <h3>---My Mission---</h3>
            <p>Seeking Spring 2026 Co-ops and Summer 2026 internships involving FPGA Test and Development, Silicon Verification, RTL Engineering, ASICs, SoC Devices, Physical Design, Digital Design, RF & EMC, Mixed Signal ICs, and mmWave. My practical experience in FPGA programming for test and verification, Verilog, System Verilog, and Synopsys synthesis, has prepared and inspired me to further my understanding of these technologies and impact their development. </p>
