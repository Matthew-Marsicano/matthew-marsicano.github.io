            <h2>Hello, I'm Matthew Marsicano</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;"> About Matthew Marsicano
Matthew Marsicano is an Electrical Engineering student at Northeastern University with a passion for ASIC design and silicon engineering, particularly in mixed-signal hardware applications. With a 3.98 GPA and expected graduation in May 2027, Matthew has distinguished himself as an emerging talent in custom silicon development for next-generation consumer products.

His expertise spans silicon design from system-level architecture through layout and verification, utilizing industry-standard tools including Cadence Virtuoso, Magic VLSI, and SKY130 PDK. Matthew's hands-on experience includes designing a 40-100MHz PLL ASIC with full schematic capture, layout, and verification through DRC/LVS checks and parasitic simulations. His technical proficiency extends to System Verilog, UVM testbenches, and FPGA implementation, demonstrated through projects like his 16-QAM baseband modulator with comprehensive I/Q imbalance and phase noise analysis.

Matthew's professional experience reflects his commitment to advancing silicon solutions across diverse applications. At Nokia Bell Labs, he optimized FPGA power consumption by modifying Verilog code for PLL, clock generation, and buffer circuits for backscatter radio systems, while designing 2 PCBs integrating RF, logic analyzer, and power circuits. His automation work reduced testbench PCB bring-up time from 20 minutes to 2 minutes across 300+ devices. His work at Draper Labs involves testing analog ASICs for power performance and radiation hardness, while his previous role at DEKA Research strengthened his embedded systems expertise with cellular modem architectures and boot optimization.

His particular interest lies in custom silicon for consumer products, low-power wearables, and telecommunications technologies. This focus drives his involvement in cutting-edge projects, from AR headset development with real-time sensor fusion to manufacturing automation systems for international deployment. Matthew's leadership role in Northeastern's Generate Product Development Studio showcases his ability to translate silicon-level innovations into market-ready products.

Recognition of Matthew's potential includes selection as one of only 10 Northeastern students for Apple's Next-gen Innovators program for Hardware Engineers, highlighting his promise in consumer electronics silicon design. His second-place finish at MIT's iQuHack quantum computing hackathon demonstrates his versatility in emerging technologies.

Through his combination of theoretical knowledge, practical experience, and industry mentorship, Matthew is positioned to contribute meaningfully to the future of mixed-signal ASIC design, particularly in applications that demand ultra-low power consumption and high integration for next-generation consumer and telecommunications products.
